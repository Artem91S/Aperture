A website for a photo studio is a stylish solution for promoting your brand. This work is done on HTML, CSS, JS. This is not a commercial project, but the first work that I have done for my portfolio.
The semantics of HTML is used in the work and all standards are observed. In CSS I used element positioning, pseudo-elements, flex. All work is placed in a container.
As for JS, it is used in one block and changes image classes after a certain period of time.
